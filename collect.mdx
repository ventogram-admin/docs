## User flow

Our collect API allows your customers to pay in local currency easily using a voucher system we've developed from the ground up.

Here's how the process looks like for your customers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User verifies identity">
    We use a simple **3 step** ID verification flow. The user only needs to
    verify identity once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User account created">
    After the user has verified their identity, we create a permanent account
    for the user to make payments to at any time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create voucher">
    Anytime the user makes payment to their account, a voucher is instantly
    created for them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redeem voucher">
    Once voucher payment is done, voucher can be redeemed. You either auto
    redeem the voucher for the user, or allowing them to manually redeem using a
    code in your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Update your merchant information

Once you get your API credentials, update your merchant details using our **update merchant record**. 

**Params:**
1. `logo` : Sets your widget logo.
2. `callbackUrl` : Your callback URL. Webhook will be sent to this URL.
3. `feeBearer` : Payee of the transaction fees.
4. `creditCurrency` : Sets which currency to be settled in after voucher is redeemed

See our [update-merchant](/api-reference/endpoint/ventogram/merchants/update-merchant-record) API reference for more details.

## Create a voucher

You can create a voucher in two different ways:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Method 1">
  ### Redirect users to our pay URL
    `https://staging.ventogram.com/v1/voucher/pay?currency=NGN&voucherId=${voucherId}&amount=${amount}&fullname=${fullname}&email=${email}&user=${merchant}&callback=${callback}`

**Params:**
1. `voucherId` : (optional) A unique ID (min length=32) generated by the merchant used to create a voucher.
2. `amount` : The value of the voucher.
3. `currency` : Currency in which voucher will be created and redeemed.
4. `fullname` : Voucher recipient full name.
5. `email` : Voucher recipient email.
6. `merchant` : Merchant's username.
7. `callback` : Successful payment redirect URL.

<Note>
  **callback:** When a payment is successful the user will be redirected to this
  URL with the `vouchercode` appended to the URL as shown below{" "}
</Note>

```bash
callback?vouchercode=samplecode
```

### Building your redirect URL

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
const redirectURL = "https://staging.ventogram.com/v1/voucher/pay"
const callback = `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/redeemvoucher`
  
const params = new URLSearchParams()  
params.append('amount', amount)  
params.append('voucherId', voucherId) 
params.append('currency', 'NGN')  
params.append('fullname', fullname)  
params.append('email', email)  
params.append('user', merchant)  
params.append('callback', callback)

const url = `${redirectURL}?${params.toString()}`

//You could redirect your users to the url just formed like so  
window.location.href = url

````
</CodeGroup>


  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Method 2">

    ### Step 1

    Use the Create Voucher API to generate a voucher id. See our [create-voucher](/api-reference/endpoint/ventogram/voucher/create-a-new-voucher-payment) reference for more details.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Request
const options = {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {accept: 'application/json', 'content-type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify({email: 'youremail@mailserver.com', fullname: 'ali deen', amount: 2000, merchant:'macdonalds'})
};

fetch('https://staging-vouchers.ventogram.com/api/v1/vouchers', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
```javascript Response 201
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "string",
  "data": {
    "id": "string"
  }
}

```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 2
  Redirect your users to the pay URL 
  `https://staging.ventogram.com/voucher/pay?voucherId=${voucherId}&callback=${callback}` to view voucher payment details.

  **Required params:**
1. `voucherId` : The id returned by the Create Voucher API from Step 1.
2. `callback` : Successful payment redirect URL.
<Note>
  **callback:** When a payment is successful the user will be redirected to this
  URL with the `vouchercode` appended to the URL as shown below{" "}
</Note>

```bash
callback?vouchercode=samplecode
```

### Building your redirect URL

<CodeGroup>
```javascript TypeScript
const redirectURL = "https://staging.ventogram.com/v1/voucher/pay"
const callback = `${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.host}/redeemvoucher`
  
const params = new URLSearchParams()  
params.append('voucherId', voucherId) 
params.append('callback', callback)

const url = `${redirectURL}?${params.toString()}`

//You could redirect your users to the url just formed like so  
window.location.href = url

````
</CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Completing the above steps using either **Method 1** or **Method 2** will issue a permanent account to the user that they can deposit funds to at any time.

## Redeem a voucher

After creating a voucher, your users will be directed to the provided callback URL upon successful payment. 

**Your callback URL will receive the following query parameters:**
1. `vouchercode` : The code used to redeem the voucher.
2. `voucherId` : The ID of the created voucher.

See our [redeem-voucher](/api-reference/endpoint/ventogram/voucher/redeem-existing-unused-voucher)  API reference for more details

<Tip>
  **feeBearer:** The `feeBearer` param allows you to choose between `client` or `merchant` as the payee of the fee. `merchant` will charge fees from your balance, while `client` will charge fees from the customer.
