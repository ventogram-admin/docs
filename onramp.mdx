## User flow

Our Onramp API allows your customers to pay in local currency easily using a voucher system we've developed from the ground up. Voucher can then be redeemed for crypto in their wallet address

Here's how the process looks like for your customers:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User verifies identity">
    We use a simple **3 step** ID verification flow. The user only needs to
    verify identity once.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User account created">
    After the user has verified their identity, we create a permanent account
    for the user to make payments to at any time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create voucher">
    Anytime the user makes payment to their account, a voucher is instantly
    created for them.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redeem voucher">
    Once voucher payment is done, voucher can be redeemed. You either auto
    redeem the voucher for the user, or allowing them to manually redeem using a
    code in your app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Withdraw crypto">
    Once voucher is redeemed, crypto is automatically sent to the wallet address included in the payment
  </Step>
</Steps>
