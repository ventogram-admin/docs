title: "Rate Tiers"

Discounts are applied on USD-NGN offramp transaction rates based on the transaction amount.
These discounts aim to provide better rates for customers transacting higher volumes.

Here are the rate tiers and applied discounts:

| Amount | Discount |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **\$51 - \$200.99**     |  0.2% |
| **\$201 - \$1,000.99**      | 0.35% |
| **\$1,001 - \$5,000.99**   | 0.55% |
| **\$5,001 - \$15,000.99**      | 0.7% |
| **\$15,001+**   | 0.9% |

These discounts are applied automatically. However, you can calculate the exact discounted rate from the base rate as follows:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node
function getDiscountedRate(transactionAmount, baseRate) {
    let discount = 0;
    const rateTiers = [
        { min: 15001, rate: 0.009 },
        { min: 5001, rate: 0.007 },
        { min: 1001, rate: 0.0055 },
        { min: 201, rate: 0.0035 },
        { min: 51, rate: 0.002 },
        { min: 0, rate: 0.0 }
    ];
    const sortedThresholds = rateTiers.sort((a, b) => b.min - a.min);
    for (const threshold of sortedThresholds) {
        if (transactionAmount >= threshold.min) {
            discount = threshold.rate;
            break;
        }
    }
    const discountedRate = baseRate * (1 + discount / 100);
    return Number(discountedRate.toFixed(2));
}

```
</CodeGroup>
